Of course. Here is a detailed implementation plan for the Frontend Developer, based on the provided document.

This plan focuses on building the user interface and experience, using a mocked backend function to allow for parallel development. The key is to rely on the agreed-upon "contract" function: `run_meow_censor_workflow(input_audio_path: str) -> str`.

-----

### \#\# Phase 1: Build the UI Shell ðŸŽ¨

**Goal:** The primary objective here is to create the complete visual layout of the application without any backend logic. You will build all the components the user will see in a static way.

1.  **Set Up the Project:**

      * Create a new file named `app.py`.
      * In a separate file, `main.py`, add the mocked `run_meow_censor_workflow` function exactly as defined in the project plan. This will be your temporary backend.

2.  **Create the Page Layout in `app.py`:**

      * **Title and Intro:** Use `st.title()` for the main heading and `st.markdown()` or `st.write()` to add the introductory text explaining what the app does.
      * **File Uploader:** Implement the file upload component using `st.file_uploader`. Configure it to accept common audio formats like 'mp3', 'wav', and 'm4a'.
        ```python
        import streamlit as st

        st.title("Meow Censor ðŸ˜¹")
        st.write("Upload an audio file, and we'll bleep out the naughty words with meows!")

        uploaded_audio_file = st.file_uploader(
            "Choose an audio file...",
            type=['mp3', 'wav', 'm4a']
        )
        ```
      * **Action Button:** Add the main button that will start the process. It should be disabled if no file has been uploaded yet.
        ```python
        if uploaded_audio_file is not None:
            st.button("Censor the Audio!")
        ```
      * **Output Placeholders:** Add the elements where the results will be displayed. These will initially be empty or hidden.
          * An audio player using `st.audio`.
          * A download button using `st.download_button`.

### \#\# Phase 2: Connect to the Mock Backend ðŸ”Œ

**Goal:** Now you'll make the UI interactive. You will wire the components together so that a user can go through the entire workflow, from uploading a file to seeing a (mocked) result.

1.  **Handle the Uploaded File:**

      * When a user uploads a file, Streamlit keeps it in memory. You need to save this file to a temporary location on the server so you can get a file path. This path is what you'll pass to the backend function.
      * Use a folder like `temp_files` to store the uploaded audio.

2.  **Trigger the Workflow:**

      * When the "Censor the Audio\!" button is clicked, your script should:
        1.  Display a loading indicator to the user with `st.spinner("Censoring in progress...")` to show that work is being done.
        2.  Call the mocked `run_meow_censor_workflow()` function from `main.py`.
        3.  Pass the path of the saved temporary file to this function.

3.  **Display the Mocked Output:**

      * The mocked function will return the path to a new, "censored" audio file (in reality, it's just a copy).
      * Use the returned file path to populate the `st.audio` player and the `st.download_button`, making them visible to the user.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    # In app.py
    from main import run_meow_censor_workflow
    import os

    # ... (previous code) ...

    if uploaded_audio_file is not None:
        if st.button("Censor the Audio!"):
            # Save uploaded file to a temporary path
            temp_dir = "temp_files"
            os.makedirs(temp_dir, exist_ok=True)
            input_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, uploaded_audio_file.name)

            with open(input_path, "wb") as f:
                f.write(uploaded_audio_file.getbuffer())

            # Show spinner and call the mock backend
            with st.spinner("Our best cats are on the job..."):
                output_path = run_meow_censor_workflow(input_path)

            # Display results
            st.success("Censoring complete!")
            st.audio(output_path)
            with open(output_path, "rb") as file:
                st.download_button(
                    label="Download Censored Audio",
                    data=file,
                    file_name=os.path.basename(output_path),
                    mime="audio/mpeg"
                )
    ```

### \#\# Phase 3: Refinement and Reach Features âœ¨

**Goal:** With the core functionality mocked and working, you can now polish the user experience and add any advanced features.

1.  **Improve UI and Error Handling:**

      * Add more detailed instructions for the user.
      * Handle potential errors gracefully. For example, show a message with `st.error()` if the backend process were to fail.
      * Refine the layout using `st.columns` or `st.container` for a cleaner look.

2.  **Implement Reach Feature: Record Audio:**

      * If time allows, you can begin implementing the "Record Audio" feature.
      * This requires an external library like `streamlit-webrtc`.
      * The goal would be to add a component that lets the user record audio directly in the browser, which can then be saved and passed to the censoring workflow just like an uploaded file.

After completing these phases, your frontend will be fully functional and ready for the final integration step, which simply involves the backend developer replacing the mock logic in `main.py` with their real implementation.
