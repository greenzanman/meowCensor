Of course. Splitting the project between two people is a great way to build it faster. The most effective way to divide this work is with a classic **Frontend and Backend split**.

This approach allows both developers to work in parallel with minimal blocking, as long as they agree on how their two parts will communicate.

Here is a parallel implementation plan for two developers.

-----

### **The Initial Team Huddle (The "Contract")** 🤝

Before starting, both developers must agree on the **function signature** for the main workflow. This is the "contract" between the frontend and backend.

**File:** `main.py`

```python
def run_meow_censor_workflow(input_audio_path: str) -> str:
    """
    Takes the path to an input audio file and returns the path
    to the new, censored audio file.
    """
    # The Backend Developer will implement this logic.
    # The Frontend Developer will call this function and can
    # start by mocking its behavior.
    print(f"Workflow started for {input_audio_path}...")
    # Mock behavior for frontend development:
    # import time
    # import shutil
    # time.sleep(5) # Simulate work
    # shutil.copy(input_audio_path, "censored_output.mp3")
    return "censored_output.mp3"
```

With this function defined, the work can be split cleanly.

### **Person A: The Frontend Developer (UI/UX Focus)** 🎨

This person is responsible for everything the user sees and interacts with. They can build the entire user experience using the mocked `run_meow_censor_workflow` function.

  * **Phase 1: Build the UI Shell (File: `app.py`)**

      * **Goal:** Create the complete user interface as defined in the design doc.
      * **Tasks:**
        1.  Set up the Streamlit page title and introduction text.
        2.  Implement the `st.file_uploader` to accept audio files.
        3.  Add the `st.button("Censor the Audio!")` to trigger the process.
        4.  Implement the `st.spinner()` to show a "processing" state when the button is clicked.
        5.  Add placeholder sections for the output audio player (`st.audio`) and the download button (`st.download_button`).

  * **Phase 2: Connect to the Mock Backend**

      * **Goal:** Make the UI fully functional using the placeholder workflow.
      * **Tasks:**
        1.  When the user uploads a file, save it to a temporary location on the server.
        2.  Wire the "Censor" button to call the `run_meow_censor_workflow()` function, passing it the path of the temporary file.
        3.  Take the file path returned by the (mocked) function and use it to populate the `st.audio` player and the `st.download_button`.

  * **Phase 3: Refinement and Reach Features**

      * **Goal:** Polish the UI and add advanced features.
      * **Tasks:**
        1.  Improve layout, add instructions for the user, and handle potential errors (e.g., uploading the wrong file type).
        2.  (Reach Feature) If time allows, begin implementing the "Record Audio" feature using a library like `streamlit-webrtc`.

-----

### **Person B: The Backend Developer (Agent & Logic Focus)** 🧠

This person is responsible for building the entire data processing pipeline. They don't need to worry about the UI and can focus purely on making the `run_meow_censor_workflow` function work as intended.

  * **Phase 1: Build the Meow Library**

      * **Goal:** Create the foundational dataset of meow sounds.
      * **Tasks:**
        1.  Write and run the `prepare_library.py` script.
        2.  This involves using the Freesound API to download files, then using `librosa` and `pandas` to trim, analyze, and catalog them into `meow_database.csv`.
        3.  Share the resulting database file with the Frontend Developer in case they need it for testing.

  * **Phase 2: Implement the Core Agents**

      * **Goal:** Create the individual functions for transcription, censoring, and audio splicing.
      * **Tasks:**
        1.  **Transcriber:** Implement the `transcribe_audio()` function using the OpenAI Whisper library.
        2.  **Censor:** Implement the `find_swear_words()` function that calls the Gemini LLM API.
        3.  **Audio Surgeon:** Implement the `splice_audio()` function using `pydub` and the meow database. This is the most complex part, involving searching the CSV, selecting the best meow, and potentially time-stretching it.

  * **Phase 3: Integrate the Backend Pipeline**

      * **Goal:** Assemble the agents into the final, working workflow.
      * **Tasks:**
        1.  Open the `main.py` file and replace the mock logic inside `run_meow_censor_workflow()` with the real, sequential calls to your three agent functions.
        2.  Test the entire backend pipeline with a local audio file to ensure it works end-to-end.

### **Final Step: Integration ✅**

Once both developers have completed their parts, the final step is to replace the mock function call in `app.py` with the real, fully implemented workflow from `main.py`. Because they agreed on the "contract" at the start, this integration should be seamless.
